On February 19, 1945, during the final stages of World War II, United States Marines launched an amphibious assault on the strategically important island of Iwo Jima. The objective was to capture the island's two airfields, which would provide a crucial staging area for future attacks on the Japanese mainland and an emergency landing strip for damaged American B-29 bombers. The heavily fortified volcanic island, approximately 650 miles south of Tokyo, was defended by an estimated 21,000 Japanese soldiers deeply entrenched in an intricate network of bunkers and tunnels. This brutal and iconic battle would rage for five weeks, becoming one of the most costly engagements in U.S. Marine Corps history due to the fierce resistance and extremely high casualty rates on both sides. The fighting is famously memorialized by the iconic flag-raising on Mount Suribachi.
