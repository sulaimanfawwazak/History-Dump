## 1963-11-23

On November 23, 1963, the iconic British science fiction television programme Doctor Who premiered on BBC Television, just one day after the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. The inaugural episode, titled "An Unearthly Child," introduced audiences to the mysterious time-traveling alien known only as the Doctor, his granddaughter Susan Foreman, and their human companions Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright. Broadcast at 5:15 PM GMT, the show immediately captivated viewers with its innovative premise involving a police box that was actually a time and space machine called the TARDIS. This landmark series quickly became a cultural phenomenon, influencing generations and evolving into the longest-running science fiction television show in the world, celebrated for its imaginative storytelling, educational elements, and the Doctor's ability to regenerate.
