## 1781-10-19

On October 19, 1781, British General Lord Charles Cornwallis officially surrendered his forces to a combined American and French army at Yorktown, Virginia. This pivotal event marked the culmination of the siege of Yorktown, where the American forces led by General George Washington and French troops under the Comte de Rochambeau had encircled Cornwallis's army. Trapped by land and sea, with the French fleet blocking British escape or reinforcement, Cornwallis was compelled to capitulate. Although peace negotiations would continue for some time, this decisive victory effectively ended major fighting in the American Revolutionary War and paved the way for the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which formally recognized the United States as an independent nation.
