## 1815-02-26

On February 26, 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte escaped from the island of Elba, where he had been exiled after his forced abdication following the Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1814. He had been sovereign of the small Mediterranean island for less than a year. With a small force of about 1,000 men, including loyal soldiers of the Imperial Guard, he sailed for France. His escape marked the beginning of his dramatic return to power, a period known as the Hundred Days, which ultimately led to his final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.
