## 1773-12-16

On December 16, 1773, a pivotal act of defiance against British rule occurred in Boston, Massachusetts. American colonists, frustrated by the Tea Act and perceived British tyranny, boarded three East India Company ships docked in Boston Harbor. Disguised as Mohawk Indians, the Sons of Liberty and their compatriots systematically dumped 342 chests of tea into the harbor. This bold act of protest against taxation without representation further inflamed tensions between Great Britain and its American colonies, becoming a significant precursor to the American Revolutionary War.
