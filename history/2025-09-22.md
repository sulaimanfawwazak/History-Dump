## 1862-09-22

On September 22, 1862, during the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. This executive order declared that if the Confederate states did not return to the Union by January 1, 1863, all enslaved people in those rebellious states would be declared free. While it did not immediately free anyone, as it applied only to areas not under Union control, it fundamentally shifted the purpose of the war from preserving the Union to also abolishing slavery. This bold move transformed the moral landscape of the conflict and discouraged European powers from supporting the Confederacy. It laid the groundwork for the final Emancipation Proclamation and the eventual end of slavery in the United States.
