On July 10, 1906, Reginald Fessenden, a Canadian-American inventor, successfully transmitted the first radio broadcast across the Atlantic Ocean.  His broadcast included music, readings from the Bible and Shakespeare, and his own voice.  The broadcast was received by ships at sea and marked a significant milestone in the development of radio communication. While reception was limited, the broadcast demonstrably proved the feasibility of transatlantic radio transmission. This achievement paved the way for future advancements and widespread adoption of radio technology.
