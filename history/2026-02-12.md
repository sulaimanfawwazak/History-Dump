## 1909-02-12

On February 12, 1909, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was founded in New York City. This biracial organization was established in response to the ongoing violence and discrimination against Black people, particularly a devastating race riot in Springfield, Illinois, in 1908. Prominent civil rights activists and journalists, including W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, and Mary Church Terrell, were among its initial founders, alongside progressive white allies. The NAACP's primary mission was to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of all persons and to eliminate race-based discrimination. It rapidly grew into one of the most significant and enduring civil rights organizations in American history.
