## 1805-10-21

On October 21, 1805, the British Royal Navy decisively defeated the combined fleets of the French and Spanish Navies in the Battle of Trafalgar. This pivotal naval engagement occurred off the southwest coast of Spain, near Cape Trafalgar. Led by Vice-Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson, the British fleet employed innovative tactics to secure a monumental victory against superior numbers. Although Britain suffered no ship losses, Nelson himself was mortally wounded during the battle. This triumph cemented British naval supremacy for over a century and effectively ended Napoleon Bonaparte's hopes of invading Britain.
