On February 21, 1965, prominent African American Muslim minister and human rights activist Malcolm X was assassinated at the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights, New York City. He was preparing to address the Organization of Afro-American Unity when he was shot multiple times by three gunmen. The assassination occurred just a week after his home had been firebombed and amid growing tensions between him and the Nation of Islam, which he had recently left. His death sent shockwaves through the Civil Rights Movement and the nation, marking a tragic loss for the fight for racial equality and justice.
