## 1965-08-11

On August 11, 1965, the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles erupted in a six-day riot after an arrest for drunk driving escalated into widespread unrest. The incident began when a white California Highway Patrol officer pulled over and arrested Marquette Frye, an African American man, and his brother Ronald. A growing crowd of residents protested the arrest, leading to a violent confrontation between police and community members. This initial spark ignited deep-seated anger over issues such as perceived police brutality, housing discrimination, and high unemployment rates within the predominantly Black community. The riots resulted in 34 deaths, over 1,000 injuries, and an estimated $40 million in property damage, marking a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement.
