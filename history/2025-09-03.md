On September 3, 1783, the Treaty of Paris was officially signed in Paris, France, by representatives of the United States and Great Britain. This pivotal agreement formally ended the American Revolutionary War, which had begun in 1775. American delegates John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay negotiated with David Hartley, a member of the British Parliament, to establish the terms of peace. The treaty recognized the Thirteen Colonies as the independent United States of America, granting them vast territorial claims and marking a significant shift in global power dynamics. Its signing cemented American sovereignty and laid the foundation for the new nation's future.
