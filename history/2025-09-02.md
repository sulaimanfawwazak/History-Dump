On September 2, 1945, World War II formally concluded with the signing of the Instrument of Surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu signed on behalf of Emperor Hirohito and the Japanese government, while General Douglas MacArthur signed for the Allied Powers. The ceremony marked the culmination of over six years of global conflict that had involved the vast majority of the world's nations. This official act followed Japan's announcement of surrender on August 15, after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, bringing a definitive end to the deadliest war in human history.
