## 1933-12-05

On December 5, 1933, the United States officially repealed Prohibition with the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution. This historic amendment reversed the Eighteenth Amendment, which had prohibited the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages nationwide for 13 years. The repeal was met with widespread celebration, bringing an end to a contentious era marked by bootlegging, speakeasies, and the rise of organized crime. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the proclamation, effectively restoring legal alcohol production and sales across the country. Its conclusion allowed individual states to set their own alcohol regulations, significantly altering American culture and commerce.
