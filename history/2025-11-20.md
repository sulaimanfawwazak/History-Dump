## 1945-11-20

On November 20, 1945, the historic Nuremberg Trials commenced in Nuremberg, Germany. This series of military tribunals, held by the Allied forces, prosecuted prominent members of the political, military, and economic leadership of Nazi Germany. Charged with crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, the defendants faced justice for atrocities committed during World War II. The trials, which lasted until October 1946, established crucial precedents in international law regarding individual accountability for war crimes, profoundly impacting post-war international justice.
