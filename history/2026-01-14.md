## 1784-01-14

On January 14, 1784, the Congress of the Confederation, meeting in Annapolis, Maryland, officially ratified the Treaty of Paris. This pivotal document had been signed in Paris on September 3, 1783, by representatives of King George III of Great Britain and the United States of America. The ratification was a crucial step, bringing a formal end to the American Revolutionary War and recognizing the United States as a sovereign and independent nation. It also established the new nation's borders and laid the groundwork for future diplomatic relations. This act concluded over eight years of conflict and cemented American independence on the world stage.
