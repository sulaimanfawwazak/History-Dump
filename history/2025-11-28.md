## 1912-11-28

On November 28, 1912, Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire, ending over five centuries of Ottoman rule. This momentous declaration took place in Vlorë, a coastal city, where Ismail Qemali raised the Albanian flag and proclaimed the formation of an independent Albanian state. The move came during the First Balkan War, as the Ottoman Empire was losing territory rapidly, and other Balkan nations were also asserting their sovereignty. Although its independence was recognized by the Great Powers in 1913, the new nation faced significant challenges in establishing its borders and governance in the subsequent years.
