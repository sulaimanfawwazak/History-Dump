On January 17, 1773, Captain James Cook, aboard HMS Resolution, became the first person known to cross the Antarctic Circle. This landmark achievement occurred during his second voyage of exploration, which aimed to discover the fabled 'Terra Australis Incognita' or southern continent. Cook and his crew ventured deep into the southern polar regions, proving that any continent existing there must be incredibly cold and largely ice-bound. Although he did not sight the Antarctic mainland, his explorations significantly advanced geographical knowledge of the southern hemisphere and disproved many myths about a temperate southern continent.
