## 1990-08-02

On August 2, 1990, Iraqi forces under the command of Saddam Hussein's regime launched a full-scale invasion of neighboring Kuwait. The unprovoked attack was primarily driven by Iraq's desire for Kuwait's vast oil reserves, coupled with long-standing disputes over alleged oil theft and debt repayment following the Iran-Iraq War. Iraqi troops swiftly overwhelmed Kuwait's defenses, leading to the rapid occupation and annexation of the small, oil-rich emirate. This aggressive act garnered widespread international condemnation and ultimately triggered the formation of a U.S.-led coalition that would later liberate Kuwait in the Gulf War. The invasion profoundly reshaped Middle Eastern geopolitics.
