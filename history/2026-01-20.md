## 1961-01-20

On January 20, 1961, John F. Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th President of the United States in Washington, D.C. At 43 years old, he became the youngest person ever elected to the office and the first Roman Catholic president. His inaugural address famously urged Americans to "ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country." The speech set a tone of idealism and civic action for his "New Frontier" administration, inspiring a generation. His presidency was cut short by assassination in November 1963.
