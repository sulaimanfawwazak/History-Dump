## 1999-12-31

On December 31, 1999, the United States officially relinquished control of the Panama Canal, transferring all remaining responsibilities and properties to the Republic of Panama. This historic handover was a culmination of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, signed in 1977, which stipulated a gradual transition of authority over the strategic waterway. The event marked the end of nearly a century of U.S. administration, initiating a new era of Panamanian sovereignty over one of the world's most vital maritime passages. The transfer was celebrated globally as a significant moment in decolonization and international relations, signifying Panama's full control over its most prized national asset.
