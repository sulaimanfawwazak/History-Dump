## 1791-12-15

On December 15, 1791, the United States Bill of Rights was officially ratified when Virginia became the 10th state to approve the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution. These amendments, proposed by James Madison, were designed to guarantee specific rights and freedoms to American citizens, such as freedom of speech, religion, and the press. Their inclusion addressed concerns raised during the Constitution's ratification debates regarding the absence of explicit protections for individual liberties. The Bill of Rights established fundamental legal and civil rights that continue to shape American jurisprudence and society. This landmark event cemented key principles of limited government and individual freedoms within the young republic.
