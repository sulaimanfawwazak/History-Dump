On January 8, 1918, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson addressed a joint session of Congress, outlining his vision for a post-World War I peace. This influential speech, known as the "Fourteen Points," aimed to establish a framework for lasting global stability and prevent future conflicts. Key proposals included self-determination for nations, freedom of the seas, open diplomacy, and the establishment of a League of Nations. Although not all points were adopted in the Treaty of Versailles, the Fourteen Points profoundly shaped international relations and the debate over the peace settlement. Its principles laid the groundwork for future international organizations and diplomatic efforts to maintain peace.
