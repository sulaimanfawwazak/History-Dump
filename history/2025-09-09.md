## 1850-09-09

On September 9, 1850, California officially became the 31st state of the United States, concluding a period of rapid development and debate following the Mexican-American War. Its admission was a crucial component of the Compromise of 1850, a series of legislative measures designed to resolve the contentious issue of slavery in the newly acquired territories. As a free state, California's entry into the Union significantly altered the delicate balance between free and slave states, exacerbating sectional tensions. The state's rapid population growth, primarily fueled by the 1849 Gold Rush, made it an economically and politically powerful addition. This momentous event had lasting implications for westward expansion and the escalating national debate leading to the Civil War.
