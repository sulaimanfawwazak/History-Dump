## 1948-01-30

On January 30, 1948, Mahatma Gandhi, the revered leader of India's independence movement, was assassinated in New Delhi. He was shot three times at close range by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, while on his way to a prayer meeting at Birla House. Gandhi's death sent shockwaves across the newly independent nation and the world, plunging India into mourning. His lifelong advocacy for nonviolent resistance (satyagraha) had been instrumental in ending British rule, and his legacy continues to inspire civil rights movements globally. The assassination occurred just months after India gained independence and was a tragic loss for a nation still grappling with the partition and communal violence.
