On January 13, 1898, French novelist Émile Zola published his open letter, titled 'J'accuse...!', on the front page of the Parisian daily newspaper L'Aurore. Addressed to President Félix Faure, the letter vehemently denounced the French government for its unlawful conviction of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish artillery officer falsely accused of treason. Zola's powerful indictment exposed the military's anti-Semitism and judicial errors, igniting a fierce public debate known as the Dreyfus Affair. This courageous act of journalism profoundly influenced public opinion and contributed to Dreyfus's eventual exoneration, highlighting the critical role of the press in holding power accountable.
