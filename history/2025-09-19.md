## 1893-09-19

On September 19, 1893, New Zealand made history by becoming the first self-governing nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote in parliamentary elections. This landmark achievement followed years of tireless campaigning by suffragists, most notably Kate Sheppard, who led the Women's Christian Temperance Union's suffrage efforts. Governor Lord Glasgow signed the new electoral act into law, enabling women aged 21 and over to participate in the upcoming general election. This pioneering move set a global precedent, inspiring women's suffrage movements in other countries and marking a significant milestone for democracy and gender equality.
