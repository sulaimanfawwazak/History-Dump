## 1980-02-22

On February 22, 1980, one of the greatest upsets in sports history unfolded at the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. The underdog United States men's national ice hockey team, comprised of amateur and collegiate players, faced the seemingly invincible Soviet Union national team. The Soviets had dominated international hockey for decades, winning the previous four Olympic gold medals and were heavily favored. Despite being massive underdogs, the young American squad triumphed with a stunning 4-3 victory in a medal-round game. This monumental achievement, quickly dubbed the "Miracle on Ice," captivated the nation and remains an iconic moment in Olympic history.
