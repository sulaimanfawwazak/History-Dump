## 1901-01-22

On January 22, 1901, Queen Victoria, the monarch who reigned for over 63 years, died at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight at the age of 81. Her death marked the end of the Victorian era, a period of immense industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and military change in the United Kingdom and its empire. Having ascended to the throne in 1837, her reign was the longest of any British monarch at that time, profoundly shaping British society and imperial policy. Her son, Edward VII, succeeded her, ushering in the Edwardian era. Her passing was a moment of national mourning and a significant turning point in British history.
