## 1904-10-27

On October 27, 1904, the first underground line of the New York City Subway system officially opened to the public. The Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) Company launched the initial 9.1-mile route, running from City Hall in Lower Manhattan to 145th Street and Broadway in Harlem. Mayor George B. McClellan conducted the ceremonial first ride, marking a significant milestone in urban transportation. This groundbreaking infrastructure project dramatically transformed daily life for millions of New Yorkers, providing a rapid and efficient way to navigate the bustling city. The subway system has since grown into one of the largest and most complex in the world.
