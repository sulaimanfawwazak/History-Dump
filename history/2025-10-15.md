## 1815-10-15

After his final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815 and subsequent surrender to the British, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. He arrived on the island on October 15, 1815, aboard HMS Northumberland, a British ship. This marked the definitive end of his political and military career, a stark contrast to his earlier, brief exile on Elba. The British government chose Saint Helena due to its extreme isolation, making escape virtually impossible. Napoleon would spend the remaining six years of his life on Saint Helena, dying there in May 1821.
