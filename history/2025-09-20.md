On September 20, 1973, the highly publicized "Battle of the Sexes" tennis match took place at the Houston Astrodome in Houston, Texas. This historic exhibition pitted 29-year-old women's tennis champion Billie Jean King against 55-year-old former men's champion Bobby Riggs. Riggs had publicly claimed that women's tennis was inferior and that he could beat any female player. King decisively defeated Riggs in three sets, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3, in front of an estimated 90 million television viewers worldwide and over 30,000 live spectators. Her victory was seen as a significant moment for women's rights and professional sports equality, challenging traditional gender roles and advocating for fair treatment and recognition for female athletes.
