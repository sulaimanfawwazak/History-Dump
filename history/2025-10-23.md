## 1983-10-23

On October 23, 1983, two separate suicide truck bomb attacks occurred in Beirut, Lebanon, targeting buildings housing multinational peacekeeping forces. The first and more devastating attack struck the barracks of the U.S. Marine Corps, killing 241 American servicemen, including 220 Marines, making it the deadliest single day for the Marine Corps since World War II. Minutes later, another truck bomb detonated at the headquarters of the French paratroopers, killing 58 French soldiers. These synchronized attacks, widely attributed to Hezbollah and Iran, were a pivotal event in the Lebanese Civil War and led to the eventual withdrawal of the international peacekeeping forces. The incident had a profound impact on U.S. foreign policy and anti-terrorism strategies.
