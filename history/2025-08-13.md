## 1961-08-13

On August 13, 1961, East Germany began constructing a barbed wire and concrete barrier between East and West Berlin. This sudden move, initiated by the East German government under Walter Ulbricht, was ostensibly to protect its population from fascists, but its true purpose was to stop the mass emigration of East Germans to the West. The barrier quickly evolved into a heavily fortified concrete wall, sealing off West Berlin and becoming a stark physical manifestation of the Iron Curtain. It dramatically intensified Cold War tensions and separated families for decades, becoming one of the most enduring symbols of the division between the communist and capitalist blocs.
