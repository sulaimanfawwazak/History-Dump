On February 6, 1952, Princess Elizabeth Windsor ascended to the British throne upon the sudden death of her father, King George VI. At the time of his passing, the new Queen was on a royal tour in Kenya with her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Her proclamation as Queen Elizabeth II marked the beginning of a historic reign that would span seven decades, making her the longest-reigning monarch in British history. She returned to the United Kingdom shortly after to begin her duties, with her formal coronation taking place more than a year later. This event ushered in a new era for the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.
