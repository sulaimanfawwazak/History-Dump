## 1949-11-26

On November 26, 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India officially adopted the Constitution of India. This momentous occasion marked a crucial step in the nation's transition to a fully sovereign democratic republic following its independence from British rule in 1947. While adopted on this date, the Constitution formally came into effect on January 26, 1950, a day now celebrated as Republic Day across the country. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, often referred to as the 'Father of the Indian Constitution,' chaired the drafting committee and played a pivotal role in its creation. The adoption of this extensive document established India as a secular, socialist, and democratic republic, outlining the fundamental rights and duties of its citizens and the structure of its government.
