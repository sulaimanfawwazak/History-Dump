On August 3, 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from Palos de la Frontera, Spain, with three ships: the Niña, the Pinta, and the Santa María. His expedition, funded by the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand II and Isabella I, aimed to find a westward sea route to the East Indies. This voyage marked the beginning of a transformative era of European exploration and colonization in the Americas. His departure initiated an event that would lead to the widespread European discovery and settlement of the New World, profoundly altering global history and geography.
