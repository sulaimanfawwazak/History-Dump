On August 19, 1839, the French government officially announced the daguerreotype process, effectively giving photography to the world. Louis Daguerre presented his invention to a joint session of the French Academy of Sciences and the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts at the Institut de France in Paris. This groundbreaking invention, a direct-positive photographic process, produced highly detailed images on a sheet of silver-plated copper. The French government purchased the patent and declared it "free to the world," sparking a global revolution in visual representation and art.
