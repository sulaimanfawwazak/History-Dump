## 1945-08-17

On August 17, 1945, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, leaders of the Indonesian nationalist movement, publicly proclaimed Indonesia's independence from Dutch colonial rule. The declaration took place in Jakarta, just two days after the Japanese surrender in World War II, which created a power vacuum. This bold move ignited the Indonesian National Revolution, a four-year armed and diplomatic struggle against the returning Dutch forces. The proclamation marked a pivotal moment for the Southeast Asian nation, laying the groundwork for its sovereignty and inspiring decolonization movements across the globe.
