## 1991-01-12

On January 12, 1991, the United States Congress passed a resolution authorizing President George H.W. Bush to use military force against Iraq. This landmark decision came after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and the failure of diplomatic efforts to secure their withdrawal. The authorization, passed by both the House and Senate, paved the way for Operation Desert Storm, a large-scale military offensive aimed at liberating Kuwait. This vote was a critical step, allowing the deployment of American troops and resources to the Persian Gulf region. The immediate impact was the intensification of preparations for a swift military intervention.
