## 1307-10-13

On Friday, October 13, 1307, King Philip IV of France initiated a coordinated mass arrest of the Knights Templar throughout France. Accusing them of heresy, idolatry, and various other crimes, Philip sought to seize their immense wealth and eliminate their influence, as he was heavily indebted to the order. This surprise action was carried out by royal agents, and many Templars were imprisoned, tortured, and eventually burned at the stake. The arrests marked the beginning of the end for the powerful medieval military order, culminating in its dissolution by Pope Clement V in 1312.
