## 1836-02-23

On February 23, 1836, the siege of the Alamo fortress in San Antonio de Béxar, Texas, commenced as Mexican forces under General Antonio López de Santa Anna arrived. A small Texian garrison, led by William B. Travis and including famous figures like Davy Crockett and James Bowie, prepared to defend the mission. This began a 13-day siege that would become a pivotal event in the Texas Revolution. The defenders, heavily outnumbered, understood the dire situation but resolved to fight to the last man. Their heroic stand, despite ending in defeat, became a rallying cry for Texan independence.
