## 1860-12-20

On December 20, 1860, South Carolina became the first state to formally secede from the United States of America. This pivotal decision was made by a state convention meeting in Charleston, a direct response to the election of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency in November of that year. Southern states widely feared that Lincoln's Republican administration would threaten the institution of slavery, which was vital to their economy and social structure. The act of secession significantly escalated the sectional crisis between the North and South, serving as a primary catalyst for the outbreak of the American Civil War just a few months later. Six more Southern states followed South Carolina's lead by February 1861, collectively forming the Confederate States of America.
