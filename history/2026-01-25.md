On January 25, 1924, the "International Winter Sports Week" officially opened in Chamonix, France. Although not initially recognized as the Olympic Games, the event was retrospectively designated as the I Olympic Winter Games by the International Olympic Committee in 1926. This landmark event featured 16 events across six sports, including figure skating, speed skating, bobsleigh, cross-country skiing, curling, and ice hockey. Athletes from 16 nations competed, marking a pivotal moment in the history of international winter sports. The success of the Chamonix games paved the way for the regular quadrennial staging of the Winter Olympics.
