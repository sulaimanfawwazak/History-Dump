## 1979-12-09

On December 9, 1979, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally certified the global eradication of smallpox, a deadly and ancient disease that had plagued humanity for millennia. This monumental achievement marked the culmination of a 12-year worldwide vaccination campaign, which involved aggressive surveillance and targeted immunization efforts. The successful elimination of smallpox made it the first human infectious disease to be completely eradicated globally, a testament to international cooperation and public health initiatives. This historic triumph remains a cornerstone of global health success and continues to inspire disease eradication efforts.
