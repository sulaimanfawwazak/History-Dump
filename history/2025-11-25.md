## 1915-11-25

On November 25, 1915, Albert Einstein presented the final form of his general theory of relativity to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. This groundbreaking theory revolutionized physics by proposing that gravity is not a force, but a curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. It superseded Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, offering a more accurate description of gravity, especially in strong gravitational fields. The theory's predictions, such as the bending of light by massive objects and the existence of black holes, were later confirmed by observations. This presentation marked a pivotal moment in 20th-century science, profoundly impacting astrophysics and cosmology.
