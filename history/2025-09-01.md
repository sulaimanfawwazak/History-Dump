## 1939-09-01

On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany launched a surprise invasion of Poland, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe. German forces, employing their 'Blitzkrieg' strategy, rapidly advanced into Polish territory from multiple directions. This unprovoked act of aggression led Britain and France, who had guaranteed Poland's borders, to declare war on Germany two days later. The invasion ignited a devastating global conflict that would last six years and claim an estimated 70 to 85 million lives. It fundamentally reshaped the geopolitical landscape and is considered one of the most significant events of the 20th century.
