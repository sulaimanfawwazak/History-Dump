## 1940-09-12

On September 12, 1940, four teenagers, Marcel Ravidat, Jacques Marsal, Georges Agnel, and Simon Coencas, stumbled upon the Lascaux Caves near Montignac, France. Their dog, Robot, fell into a hole, leading them to discover one of the most significant archaeological finds of the 20th century. Inside, they found a complex system of caves adorned with hundreds of stunning Upper Paleolithic wall paintings and engravings. These artworks, dating back approximately 17,000 years, primarily depict large animals, offering invaluable insights into the artistic and cultural practices of early humans. The site quickly became a UNESCO World Heritage Site, although public access was later restricted to protect the fragile prehistoric art.
