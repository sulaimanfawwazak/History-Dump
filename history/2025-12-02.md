On December 2, 1942, a team of scientists led by Enrico Fermi successfully initiated the world's first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction at the University of Chicago. This groundbreaking experiment, conducted in a squash court beneath the stands of Stagg Field, was a pivotal moment in the top-secret World War II research and development undertaking known as the Manhattan Project. Codenamed "Chicago Pile-1" (CP-1), the reactor demonstrated the feasibility of controlled nuclear fission. This monumental achievement laid the foundation for the development of the atomic bomb and subsequently for nuclear power generation, profoundly altering the course of science, warfare, and energy.
