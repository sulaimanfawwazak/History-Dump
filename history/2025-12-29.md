## 1890-12-29

On December 29, 1890, the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment surrounded a band of Lakota Sioux near Wounded Knee Creek on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The soldiers attempted to disarm the Lakota, leading to a confrontation that escalated into a brutal massacre. Estimates suggest that between 250 and 300 Lakota people, many of whom were unarmed women and children, were killed, while 25 U.S. soldiers also died. This tragic event is widely considered the last major armed conflict between the Lakota and the United States Army, marking a somber end to the American Indian Wars.
