## 1944-08-25

In August 1944, as Allied forces advanced across France, the French Resistance staged an uprising in Paris, leading to street fighting. On August 25, 1944, the German garrison commander, General Dietrich von Choltitz, defied Adolf Hitler's orders to destroy the city and surrendered to French General Philippe Leclerc and the Free French forces, supported by the U.S. 4th Infantry Division. This pivotal event marked the end of four years of Nazi occupation of the French capital. The liberation was met with immense joy and celebration by the Parisian populace, symbolizing a significant turning point in World War II in Western Europe. General Charles de Gaulle made a triumphant return to the city, delivering a famous speech from the HÃ´tel de Ville.
