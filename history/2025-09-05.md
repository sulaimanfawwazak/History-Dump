On September 5, 1972, during the Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, the Palestinian terrorist group Black September stormed the Olympic Village. They took eleven Israeli Olympic team members hostage, along with a West German police officer. The crisis escalated throughout the day, leading to a tragic standoff. Ultimately, all eleven Israeli hostages, five Palestinian terrorists, and one West German police officer were killed in a botched rescue attempt at FÃ¼rstenfeldbruck air base. This devastating event led to the suspension of the Olympic Games for 24 hours and had a profound impact on international security measures.
