On September 6, 1901, U.S. President William McKinley was shot twice by anarchist Leon Czolgosz while attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. McKinley had just delivered a speech and was greeting the public when Czolgosz, with a pistol concealed under a handkerchief, fired at close range. Although initial reports suggested he would recover, the president's condition worsened due to infection. He ultimately succumbed to his wounds eight days later on September 14, making Theodore Roosevelt the youngest president in U.S. history.
