## 1883-08-27

On August 27, 1883, the Krakatoa volcano, situated in the Sunda Strait between the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra, experienced a series of exceptionally violent eruptions. The most powerful of these eruptions produced immense tsunamis, with waves reaching up to 40 meters (130 feet) that caused widespread devastation along coastal areas. The eruption column propelled ash and pumice to an astonishing height of 27 kilometers (17 miles) into the atmosphere. The thunderous sound of the eruption was reportedly heard thousands of kilometers away, making it one of the loudest events in recorded history. This catastrophic event resulted in over 36,000 deaths, primarily from the tsunamis, and led to a noticeable cooling effect on global temperatures due to the vast amounts of ash dispersed worldwide.
