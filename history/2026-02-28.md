## 1991-02-28

On February 28, 1991, a ceasefire was declared, officially ending the Persian Gulf War after seven months of conflict. This came following a decisive 100-hour ground offensive known as Operation Desert Storm, which successfully liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. U.S. President George H.W. Bush announced the suspension of offensive operations, citing the achievement of coalition objectives. The conflict involved a massive international coalition, led by the United States, formed in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The ceasefire marked a comprehensive victory for the coalition forces and restored Kuwait's sovereignty.
