On July 31, 1971, Apollo 15 astronauts David Scott and James Irwin made history by becoming the first humans to drive a vehicle on the Moon. They piloted the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) from their landing site at Hadley Rille, significantly enhancing their mobility and range. This groundbreaking use of the LRV allowed them to travel much farther from their Lunar Module than previous missions, covering a total of 27.76 kilometers over three lunar excursions. The increased mobility proved crucial for collecting a wider array of geological samples and conducting more extensive scientific experiments, vastly expanding humanity's understanding of the Moon's geology and composition.
