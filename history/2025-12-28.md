On December 28, 1895, Auguste and Louis Lumière presented the first commercial public screening of cinematographic films at the Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris, France. This pivotal event is widely considered the birth of cinema as a public entertainment medium. For the price of one franc, approximately 33 fascinated attendees watched ten short films, including the famous "Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory." The success of this presentation marked a new era in visual storytelling and entertainment, quickly leading to the global spread of film technology. It laid the foundation for the entire motion picture industry that exists today.
