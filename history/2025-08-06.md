## 1945-08-06

On August 6, 1945, during the final stages of World War II, the United States dropped an atomic bomb, codenamed 'Little Boy,' on the city of Hiroshima, Japan. This devastating attack marked the first use of a nuclear weapon in warfare, targeting a major urban center and military headquarters. The bombing resulted in the immediate deaths of tens of thousands of people and caused widespread destruction, with many more succumbing to injuries and radiation sickness in the following weeks and months. The event was a critical turning point in the war, intended to pressure Japan into unconditional surrender and prevent a costly ground invasion. Three days later, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, leading to Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945.
