## 1789-09-25

On September 25, 1789, the First United States Congress, meeting in Federal Hall in New York City, passed 12 proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution. These amendments, drafted primarily by James Madison, were then sent to the states for ratification. Ten of these twelve proposals were subsequently ratified by three-fourths of the states by December 15, 1791, becoming what is now known as the Bill of Rights. This foundational document guarantees fundamental personal freedoms, such as freedom of speech, religion, and the right to a fair trial, and limits the government's power. It was a crucial step in ensuring individual liberties and addressing concerns from Anti-Federalists who sought stronger protections against potential government overreach.
