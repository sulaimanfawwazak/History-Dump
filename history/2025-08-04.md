## 1914-08-04

On August 4, 1914, Great Britain officially declared war on Germany. This momentous decision came after Germany violated Belgian neutrality by invading the country, which was a treaty obligation for Britain to defend. Germany's invasion of Belgium was part of its Schlieffen Plan, aiming for a swift victory over France. The declaration of war by Britain marked its entry into World War I, transforming the conflict into a truly global struggle. This event dramatically escalated the European crisis into a full-scale world war.
