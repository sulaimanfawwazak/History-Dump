## 1967-10-02

On October 2, 1967, Thurgood Marshall was officially sworn in as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. This momentous occasion made him the first African American to serve on the nation's highest judicial body. Appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Marshall's confirmation was a landmark achievement during the Civil Rights era. His distinguished career prior to the Supreme Court included arguing the pivotal Brown v. Board of Education case, which outlawed segregation in public schools. Marshall's tenure on the Court, lasting 24 years, cemented his legacy as a tireless advocate for civil rights and individual liberties.
