On September 4, 1998, Google Inc. was officially founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The company originated from their research project at Stanford University, where they developed a search engine algorithm called BackRub. Initially operating out of a friend's garage in Menlo Park, California, their mission was to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. This founding marked a pivotal moment in the development of the internet, leading to the creation of one of the world's most dominant technology companies. Google's innovative approach to search quickly revolutionized how people find information online, profoundly impacting daily life and the digital economy.
