## 1825-09-27

On September 27, 1825, the Stockton and Darlington Railway officially opened in England, marking a pivotal moment in the history of transportation. This was the first public railway in the world to use steam locomotives for hauling passengers and goods, with George Stephenson's Locomotion No. 1 making the inaugural run. The initial journey covered approximately 25 miles, primarily transporting coal from the mines in Shildon to the port of Stockton-on-Tees for export. While earlier railways existed for industrial use, the Stockton and Darlington Railway demonstrated the commercial viability of steam-powered rail transport. Its success fundamentally transformed industrial and passenger travel, ushering in the age of railways.
