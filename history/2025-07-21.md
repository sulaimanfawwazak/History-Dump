On July 21, 1903, Orville Wright piloted the Wright Flyer I, making the first successful sustained flight of a heavier-than-air machine. The flight, lasting just 12 seconds, took place near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.  This pivotal moment in aviation history marked the beginning of the age of flight and demonstrated the viability of controlled, sustained flight powered by an internal combustion engine. This short flight was followed by several additional successful flights on the same day.
