## 1968-08-20

On August 20, 1968, armies from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany, and Poland invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the liberal reforms of Alexander Dubček's government, an era known as the Prague Spring. The invasion, involving hundreds of thousands of troops and thousands of tanks, quickly overwhelmed the relatively peaceful Czechoslovak resistance. Despite widespread international condemnation, the occupation effectively ended Dubček's reforms and cemented Soviet control over the Eastern Bloc. This event demonstrated the Brezhnev Doctrine, which asserted the USSR's right to intervene in socialist countries perceived to be drifting from orthodox communism. The occupation lasted for decades, profoundly impacting Czechoslovakia's political and social landscape.
