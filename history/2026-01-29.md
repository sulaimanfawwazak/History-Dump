On January 29, 1886, German inventor Karl Benz received the patent for his "gas engine-powered automobile," known as the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. This three-wheeled vehicle, developed in 1885, is widely regarded as the world's first true automobile, designed to be propelled by an internal combustion engine. Benz's wife, Bertha Benz, played a crucial role by undertaking the first long-distance automobile journey in 1888, demonstrating its practicality. This invention marked a pivotal moment in transportation history, laying the foundation for the modern automotive industry and revolutionizing personal mobility.
