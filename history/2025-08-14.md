## 1945-08-14

On August 14, 1945, Imperial Japan formally announced its acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, effectively agreeing to an unconditional surrender to the Allied powers. This pivotal decision, conveyed through Switzerland and broadcast to the Japanese populace the following day by Emperor Hirohito, marked the end of World War II. The surrender came swiftly after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Soviet Union's declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria. Although the formal signing ceremony would occur on September 2 aboard the USS Missouri, August 14 is widely recognized as V-J Day (Victory over Japan Day) in many Allied nations. The news sparked widespread celebrations globally, concluding the deadliest conflict in human history.
