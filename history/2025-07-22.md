On July 22, 1909, Guglielmo Marconi successfully transmitted a radio signal across the Atlantic Ocean from Cornwall, England, to Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada.  The signal was received by Marconi's team and contained the letter 'S' in Morse code, representing the first successful transatlantic wireless communication.

It paved the way for widespread use of radio for communication and broadcast.
