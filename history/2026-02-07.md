On February 7, 1992, the Treaty on European Union, commonly known as the Maastricht Treaty, was signed in Maastricht, Netherlands, by members of the European Economic Community. This landmark agreement established the European Union, laying the groundwork for a common foreign and security policy, closer cooperation on justice and home affairs, and the creation of an economic and monetary union. It outlined the phased introduction of a single currency, the euro, and significantly deepened European integration. The treaty came into force on November 1, 1993, and has since been a foundational document of the EU, profoundly shaping its political and economic landscape.
