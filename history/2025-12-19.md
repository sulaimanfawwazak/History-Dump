Charles Dickens's timeless novella, "A Christmas Carol," was first published on December 19, 1843. Illustrated by John Leech, the story quickly became a sensation, selling out its initial print run by Christmas Eve. It tells the tale of Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly old man who is transformed into a benevolent figure after being visited by the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley, and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come. The book's profound message of redemption, charity, and goodwill significantly influenced the modern celebration of Christmas and remains a beloved literary classic worldwide. Its immediate success helped to shape Victorian attitudes towards poverty and social responsibility.
