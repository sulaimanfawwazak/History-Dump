## 1967-10-09

Ernesto "Che" Guevara, a prominent Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and military theorist, was executed on October 9, 1967, in La Higuera, Bolivia. He had been captured the previous day by Bolivian Army forces, aided by the CIA, during a counter-insurgency operation. His capture and summary execution were ordered to prevent him from becoming a martyr figure and rallying point for future revolutionary movements. This event marked the end of his attempts to spark a continent-wide revolution in South America and solidified his image as an icon of rebellion.
