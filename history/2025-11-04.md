On November 4, 1922, British archaeologist Howard Carter and his team made a groundbreaking discovery in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. After years of searching funded by Lord Carnarvon, Carter uncovered the entrance to the largely intact tomb of Tutankhamun, a pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty. This discovery, containing thousands of incredibly preserved artifacts, provided an unprecedented look into ancient Egyptian burial practices and royal life. The sensational find immediately captivated the world's attention and remains one of the most significant archaeological discoveries in history.
