On January 4, 2004, NASA's Mars Exploration Rover, Spirit, successfully landed on the surface of Mars. Touchdown occurred in Gusev Crater, a massive impact crater chosen for its potential to hold evidence of past water activity. Spirit was the first of two twin rovers (the second being Opportunity) designed for a 90-day mission to explore the Martian geology and search for signs of water. Exceeding all expectations, Spirit operated for over six years, fundamentally changing our understanding of the Red Planet's history and potential for life before ceasing communications in 2010.
