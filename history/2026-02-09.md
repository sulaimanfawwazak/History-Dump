## 1969-02-09

The Boeing 747, a wide-body commercial jet airliner and one of the world's most recognizable aircraft, made its first flight on February 9, 1969. Piloted by Jack Waddell and Brien Wygle, the "Jumbo Jet" took off from Everett, Washington, where Boeing's immense assembly plant is located. This monumental flight marked a new era in air travel, enabling more passengers to fly further and more affordably. The 747 revolutionized commercial aviation and remained in continuous production for over 50 years, until its final delivery in January 2023.
