## 1917-12-06

On December 6, 1917, the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, was devastated by the largest man-made explosion prior to the atomic bomb era. The French cargo ship Mont-Blanc, fully loaded with high explosives, collided with the Belgian relief ship Imo in the Halifax Harbour. The resulting fire on the Mont-Blanc led to a massive detonation, obliterating a large section of Halifax's North End and causing a tsunami. Approximately 2,000 people were killed instantly or died later from injuries, and 9,000 more were injured, with thousands left homeless and blinded.
