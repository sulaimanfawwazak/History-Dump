## 1917-11-07

On November 7, 1917 (October 25 on the Julian calendar), the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, launched an armed insurrection in Petrograd, Russia. This decisive event saw Bolshevik Red Guards storm the Winter Palace, the seat of the Provisional Government, effectively overthrowing it. The revolution resulted in the establishment of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, laying the foundation for the Soviet Union. This profound political upheaval ended centuries of Tsarist rule and ignited a global communist movement, reshaping the 20th century's geopolitical landscape.
