## 1848-01-24

On January 24, 1848, James W. Marshall discovered gold flakes at Sutter's Mill near Coloma, California, while overseeing the construction of a sawmill for John Sutter. This serendipitous finding, initially kept secret, quickly spread, sparking a massive influx of prospectors from around the world. The discovery triggered the California Gold Rush, one of the most significant migrations in American history. It dramatically accelerated California's population growth, leading to its statehood in 1850, and profoundly impacted the economic and social development of the American West. The event reshaped the demographic landscape and economic prosperity of the region.
