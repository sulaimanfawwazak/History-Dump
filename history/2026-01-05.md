## 1914-01-05

On January 5, 1914, the Ford Motor Company, under the leadership of Henry Ford, made a groundbreaking announcement: it would double its workers' wages to $5 per day and reduce the workday from nine to eight hours. This revolutionary change, implemented at a time when industrial workers typically earned less, aimed to boost employee loyalty, reduce turnover, and enable workers to afford the cars they produced. While seen by some as radical, Ford believed that a well-paid workforce would create a stable and productive environment, ultimately benefiting the company's mass production goals. This decision significantly influenced American labor practices and the rise of the middle class.
