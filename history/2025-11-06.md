## 1860-11-06

On November 6, 1860, Abraham Lincoln, a Republican from Illinois, was elected the 16th President of the United States. His victory, secured without a single Southern electoral vote, was a major catalyst for the secession of Southern states. Lincoln's anti-slavery stance and the Republican platform opposing the expansion of slavery into new territories were perceived as a direct threat to the institution of slavery. This election ultimately precipitated the American Civil War, which began just a few months after his inauguration.
