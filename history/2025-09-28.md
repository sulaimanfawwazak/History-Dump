On September 28, 1928, Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming made a groundbreaking discovery at St. Mary's Hospital in London. While studying Staphylococcus bacteria, he observed that a mold, later identified as Penicillium notatum, had contaminated one of his petri dishes. Crucially, the bacteria around the mold colonies had been destroyed, leading him to hypothesize the mold produced an antibacterial substance. This accidental observation led to the isolation of penicillin, the world's first antibiotic. Although its full potential was not immediately realized, this discovery revolutionized medicine and eventually saved countless lives.
