## 1911-08-21

On August 21, 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's iconic masterpiece, the Mona Lisa, was stolen from the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian handyman who had previously worked at the Louvre, committed the theft, believing the painting should be returned to Italy. The audacious act caused a worldwide sensation, leading to a massive police investigation and widespread public grief over the missing artwork. The painting remained missing for over two years until Peruggia attempted to sell it in Florence, Italy, in December 1913, leading to its recovery and eventual return to the Louvre.
