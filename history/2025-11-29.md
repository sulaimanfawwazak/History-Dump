## 1947-11-29

On November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 181, often referred to as the Partition Plan for Palestine. This pivotal resolution recommended dividing the British Mandate of Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states, with Jerusalem designated as a special international zone. The plan was endorsed by Jewish leaders but rejected by Arab leaders, who viewed it as a violation of their rights. Its passage ignited significant conflict, setting the stage for the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and profoundly shaping the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East.
