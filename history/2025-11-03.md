On November 3, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 2, carrying a dog named Laika, making her the first living creature from Earth to orbit the planet. This groundbreaking mission was a major propaganda victory for the USSR during the height of the Space Race, demonstrating its advanced rocketry capabilities to the world. Laika, a stray found on the streets of Moscow, was selected after extensive training and was enclosed in a pressurized cabin designed for her journey. Although the mission proved that a living organism could withstand launch and microgravity, Sputnik 2 was not designed to return to Earth, and Laika tragically perished hours after launch due to overheating. Her historic journey, while controversial from an animal welfare perspective, provided crucial data that paved the way for human spaceflight.
