## 1848-02-02

On February 2, 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in Guadalupe Hidalgo, a town near Mexico City, officially ending the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). Under the terms of this pivotal treaty, Mexico agreed to cede a vast territory, known as the Mexican Cession, to the United States for $15 million. This expansive land included present-day California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, and Oklahoma. The treaty established the current border between the United States and Mexico, primarily along the Rio Grande. Its signing dramatically expanded the territory of the United States, fulfilling its Manifest Destiny.
