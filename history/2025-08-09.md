On August 9, 1974, Richard Nixon became the first, and to date only, U.S. President to resign from office. His resignation came amidst the escalating Watergate scandal, a political scandal involving a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and subsequent cover-up by the Nixon administration. Facing certain impeachment by the House of Representatives and a likely conviction by the Senate, Nixon announced his decision the previous evening. His departure marked a tumultuous period in American political history, shaking public trust in government and setting a precedent for presidential accountability. Gerald Ford, then Vice President, succeeded him immediately.
