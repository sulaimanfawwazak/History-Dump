## 1867-10-18

On October 18, 1867, the formal ceremony for the transfer of Alaska from Russia to the United States took place in Sitka, Alaska, then the capital of Russian America. This marked the completion of the Alaska Purchase, a treaty negotiated earlier in the year for $7.2 million. U.S. General Lovell Rousseau and Russian Commissioner Captain Aleksei Pestchouroff presided over the event, which involved lowering the Russian flag and raising the American flag. The acquisition added over 586,000 square miles to U.S. territory, a move initially met with some skepticism but eventually proven to be a strategic and resource-rich asset.
