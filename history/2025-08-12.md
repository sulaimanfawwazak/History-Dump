## 1981-08-12

On August 12, 1981, International Business Machines (IBM) unveiled its groundbreaking IBM Personal Computer (model 5150) at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. This event marked a pivotal moment in computing history, as the "Big Blue" officially entered the burgeoning personal computer market, which had previously been dominated by smaller companies. Developed rapidly by a special task force led by Philip "Don" Estridge, the IBM PC's success was largely attributed to its open architecture, which encouraged third-party hardware and software development, notably utilizing Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system. Its introduction legitimized personal computing for businesses and consumers alike, quickly becoming the de facto industry standard and driving the exponential growth of the PC ecosystem. The IBM PC fundamentally reshaped the technology landscape, laying the foundation for the modern computer industry and ushering in the era of widespread personal computing.
