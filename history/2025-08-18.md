## 1920-08-18

On August 18, 1920, the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified, officially granting women the right to vote across the United States. This historic moment occurred when Tennessee became the 36th state to approve the amendment, providing the necessary three-fourths majority for its passage. The ratification was the culmination of a decades-long struggle by the women's suffrage movement, led by tireless advocates such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Its passage marked a monumental victory for civil rights and significantly expanded democratic participation in the United States, forever changing the nation's political landscape. This foundational change gave millions of American women a voice in their government.
