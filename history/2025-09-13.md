## 1993-09-13

On September 13, 1993, the historic Oslo I Accord was officially signed in Washington, D.C., marking a significant step in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The agreement, formally known as the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, was signed by Yasser Arafat for the Palestine Liberation Organization and Shimon Peres for Israel, witnessed by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. It established a framework for future relations and led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority. Although it did not result in a lasting peace, the accord represented a momentous mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO and offered a hopeful, albeit ultimately unfulfilled, vision for coexistence.
