On January 11, 1964, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Luther Terry released a comprehensive report titled "Smoking and Health." This groundbreaking document definitively linked cigarette smoking to various serious diseases, including lung cancer and heart disease, marking a pivotal moment in public health. The report, compiled by an advisory committee of ten scientists, was deliberately released on a Saturday to minimize immediate stock market impact. Its findings led to widespread public awareness campaigns, mandatory health warnings on cigarette packs, and ultimately significant changes in smoking behavior and tobacco industry regulation globally.
