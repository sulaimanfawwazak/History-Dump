## 1956-12-04

On December 4, 1956, an impromptu jam session occurred at Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, bringing together four legendary figures of early rock and roll: Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash. The gathering began when Elvis, then a major star, dropped by the studio while Perkins was recording with Lewis playing piano. Johnny Cash also arrived, leading to an iconic moment in music history. The session was largely spontaneous, with the musicians playing gospel songs, country tunes, and early rock and roll numbers. The recordings from this legendary day were eventually released, solidifying the event's place as a pivotal moment in the formation of rock and roll and American popular music.
