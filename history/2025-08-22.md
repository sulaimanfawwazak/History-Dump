On August 22, 1485, the Battle of Bosworth Field was fought in Leicestershire, England, marking the decisive end of the Wars of the Roses. This pivotal engagement saw the forces of King Richard III, the last Plantagenet monarch, clash with those of Henry Tudor, a claimant to the throne. Richard III was famously killed during the battle, becoming the last English king to die in combat. Henry Tudor subsequently ascended to the throne as King Henry VII, establishing the Tudor dynasty and bringing a tumultuous period of civil strife to a close. His victory ushered in a new era for England.
