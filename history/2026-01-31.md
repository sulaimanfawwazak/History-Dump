## 1958-01-31

On January 31, 1958, the United States successfully launched Explorer 1, its first artificial satellite, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. This launch marked America's entry into the Space Race, a direct response to the Soviet Union's earlier Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2 launches. Developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and designed by Dr. Wernher von Braun's team, Explorer 1 carried scientific instruments primarily built by James Van Allen. The satellite's data led to the discovery of the Earth's radiation belts, now known as the Van Allen belts, a significant scientific milestone. Explorer 1 transmitted data for nearly four months and remained in orbit for over 12 years before re-entering the atmosphere.
