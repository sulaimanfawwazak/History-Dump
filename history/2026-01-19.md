On January 19, 1915, Germany launched the first large-scale air raid on Great Britain during World War I, utilizing two Zeppelin airships. The targets were the coastal towns of Great Yarmouth, Sheringham, and King's Lynn in Norfolk, England. These early raids, though militarily limited, resulted in civilian casualties and property damage, marking a new terrifying dimension of warfare. The psychological impact on the British public was profound, as it demonstrated that the homeland was vulnerable to attack from the air. This event significantly foreshadowed the widespread aerial bombing campaigns that would characterize future conflicts.
