## 1907-11-16

On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was officially admitted to the United States as the 46th state by President Theodore Roosevelt. This momentous event culminated years of political maneuvering and settlement in the region. The new state was formed by merging Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory, areas with distinct histories and populations, including numerous Native American tribes who had been relocated there. The admission ceremonies took place in Guthrie, which served as the first state capital before Oklahoma City was later designated. This expansion marked a significant chapter in the westward development of the United States.
