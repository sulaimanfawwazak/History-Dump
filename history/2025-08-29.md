## 1949-08-29

On August 29, 1949, the Soviet Union successfully tested its first atomic bomb, code-named "RDS-1" (also known as "First Lightning"). The detonation occurred at the Semipalatinsk Test Site in the Kazakh SSR, sending a clear signal of the USSR's emergent nuclear capability. This pivotal event, detected by U.S. aircrews and officially confirmed by President Truman on September 23, dramatically ended the American nuclear monopoly. It profoundly altered the global balance of power, marking a significant escalation in the burgeoning Cold War and intensifying the arms race between the two superpowers, thereby shaping geopolitical strategy for decades to come.
