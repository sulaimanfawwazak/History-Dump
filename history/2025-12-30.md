## 1922-12-30

On December 30, 1922, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was officially established through the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, signed in Moscow. This historic agreement formally unified the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Transcaucasian SFSR, Ukrainian SSR, and Byelorussian SSR into a single federal state. The creation of the USSR marked the formal culmination of the Russian Civil War and the consolidation of Bolshevik power under Vladimir Lenin's leadership. It created the world's first constitutionally socialist state, which would become a major global superpower. The USSR's establishment set the stage for a new political and economic order that profoundly influenced world events for nearly seven decades.
