## 1939-08-23

On August 23, 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in Moscow. This non-aggression treaty, officially known as the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, also contained a secret protocol. The protocol divided Northern and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence, notably regarding Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania. The pact effectively paved the way for Germany's invasion of Poland just over a week later, marking the beginning of World War II, and allowed the Soviets to occupy the Baltic states and parts of Poland. Its signing sent shockwaves across the globe and demonstrated a cynical short-term alliance between two ideologically opposed powers.
