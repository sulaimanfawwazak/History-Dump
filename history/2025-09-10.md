## 1919-09-10

On September 10, 1919, the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye was formally signed between the victorious Allied Powers and the newly formed Republic of Austria. This pivotal agreement officially concluded World War I for Austria and marked the dismemberment of the vast Austro-Hungarian Empire. The treaty significantly reduced Austria's territory, establishing its new borders and recognizing the independence of several new states, including Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). Furthermore, it imposed substantial war reparations and strict military limitations on Austria, profoundly reshaping the political and geographical landscape of Central Europe.
