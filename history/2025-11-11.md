## 1918-11-11

On November 11, 1918, at 5:00 AM, an armistice was signed in a railway carriage in Compiègne Forest, France, between the Allies and Germany. This agreement formally ended the fighting on the Western Front of World War I, which had raged for over four years and claimed millions of lives. Hostilities ceased exactly at 11:00 AM Paris time ("the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month"), a symbolic moment still commemorated today. The armistice marked a pivotal moment in global history, leading to the Treaty of Versailles the following year and the redrawing of national borders. It is still observed in many countries as Remembrance Day or Veterans Day.
