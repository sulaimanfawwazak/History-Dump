On August 7, 1947, Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki raft completed its epic 101-day journey across the Pacific Ocean, landing on the Raroia Atoll in the Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia. Heyerdahl and his five-man crew embarked on this perilous voyage from Callao, Peru, to demonstrate his theory that ancient South Americans could have settled Polynesia using balsa wood rafts. The 8,000-kilometer (5,000-mile) voyage proved the feasibility of such trans-oceanic travel, though it did not definitively prove his specific theory of Polynesian origins. The expedition gained worldwide fame, inspiring books and an Oscar-winning documentary. It stands as a remarkable testament to human ingenuity and the spirit of exploration.
