On August 7, 1942, during World War II, the United States launched its first major offensive against the Empire of Japan. U.S. Marines landed on the islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida in the Solomon Islands. The primary objective was to capture Henderson Field, an airfield under construction by the Japanese on Guadalcanal, to prevent its use against Allied supply lines to Australia. This marked the beginning of a brutal and protracted six-month campaign of attrition, characterized by fierce jungle warfare and naval battles, ultimately resulting in an Allied victory and a critical turning point in the Pacific War.
