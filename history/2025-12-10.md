## 1948-12-10

On December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in Paris, France. This landmark document was proclaimed as a common standard of achievements for all peoples and all nations, outlining fundamental human rights to be universally protected. Eleanor Roosevelt notably chaired the drafting committee, which included diverse international representation to ensure a global perspective. The UDHR's 30 articles cover civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, serving as a foundational reference for international human rights law. Its adoption marked a pivotal moment in post-World War II efforts to prevent future atrocities and promote global peace and justice.
