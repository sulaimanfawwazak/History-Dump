## 1959-01-03

On January 3, 1959, Alaska officially joined the United States as its 49th state. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the official proclamation, completing a lengthy process that began with the Alaska Statehood Act passed by Congress in 1958. This significant event expanded the nation's landmass considerably, adding the largest and most northern state. The admission of Alaska, a vast territory rich in natural resources and strategic importance, marked a new chapter for both the territory's residents and the United States as a whole. Its statehood also paved the way for Hawaii to follow later that same year, becoming the 50th state.
