## 1914-08-01

On August 1, 1914, Germany declared war on Russia, a pivotal act that escalated the brewing European crisis into the First World War. This declaration followed Russia's full mobilization in response to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Serbia, a move perceived by Germany as a direct threat. The complex web of alliances, including the Triple Entente (France, Britain, Russia) and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary), rapidly brought other nations into the conflict. This act marked the full onset of a global war that would dramatically reshape the political landscape of the 20th century and result in unprecedented casualties.
