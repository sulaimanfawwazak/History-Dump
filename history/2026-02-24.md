## 1803-02-24

On February 24, 1803, the U.S. Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John Marshall, issued its landmark decision in the case of Marbury v. Madison. This pivotal ruling arose from a political dispute over judicial appointments made by outgoing President John Adams. William Marbury, one of Adams's "midnight judges," petitioned the Supreme Court to compel Secretary of State James Madison to deliver his commission. While the Court found that Marbury was indeed entitled to his commission, it ultimately declared unconstitutional a portion of the Judiciary Act of 1789 that had granted the Supreme Court the power to issue such writs. This monumental decision established the principle of judicial review, granting the Supreme Court the authority to declare acts of the legislative and executive branches unconstitutional, fundamentally shaping the balance of power in American government.
