## 1953-07-27

On July 27, 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed at Panmunjom, effectively ending the active fighting of the Korean War. Representatives from the United Nations Command, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army signed the agreement, which established a demilitarized zone (DMZ) along the 38th parallel. Although a truce was established, a formal peace treaty was never signed, leaving the two Koreas technically still at war. The armistice created a fragile but enduring ceasefire, shaping the geopolitical landscape of East Asia for decades to come.
