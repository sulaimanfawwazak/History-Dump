## 1981-10-06

Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was assassinated on October 6, 1981, during a military parade in Cairo commemorating the eighth anniversary of the Yom Kippur War. He was shot by fundamentalist army officers belonging to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli. The assassination was largely in retaliation for Sadat's signing of the Egyptâ€“Israel peace treaty in 1979 and his subsequent crackdown on Islamist opposition within Egypt. Vice President Hosni Mubarak, who was also wounded during the attack, succeeded him as president. This dramatic event sent shockwaves globally and profoundly impacted Egyptian and Middle Eastern politics for decades.
