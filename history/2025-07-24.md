## 1911-07-24

On July 24, 1911, American explorer Hiram Bingham III, sponsored by Yale University and the National Geographic Society, was led by a local guide to the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu in Peru. Although local Quechua farmers were already aware of the site, Bingham's expedition brought international attention to the remote ruins. His findings, which he initially believed to be Vilcabamba, the 'Lost City of the Incas,' sparked global interest in Inca civilization. This rediscovery proved instrumental in archaeological studies and established Machu Picchu as one of the world's most iconic and revered historical sites, drawing millions of visitors annually.
