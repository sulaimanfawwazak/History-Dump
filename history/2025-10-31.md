On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther, a German monk and theology professor, posted his Ninety-five Theses on the door of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg, Saxony. This document was a forceful academic challenge to the practices of the Catholic Church, particularly the sale of indulgences, which Luther believed undermined genuine repentance and salvation. His theses questioned the Pope's authority to grant remission of temporal punishment for sins and argued that salvation is achieved through faith alone, not through monetary contributions or good works. While initially intended for academic debate, the rapid dissemination of Luther's ideas, facilitated by the printing press, sparked widespread theological controversy. This event is widely regarded as the foundational act and an enduring symbol of the Protestant Reformation, forever altering the course of Christianity and European history.
