## 1941-12-07

On December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise military strike against the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii. The attack involved 353 Japanese aircraft, launched from six aircraft carriers, targeting American battleships and airfields. This devastating assault killed over 2,400 Americans, wounded more than 1,000, and severely damaged or destroyed 18 U.S. Navy ships, including five battleships. Fortunately, key U.S. aircraft carriers were out at sea and escaped destruction, proving crucial later in the war. The following day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared December 7th "a date which will live in infamy," leading to the United States' formal entry into World War II.
