## 1831-12-27

On December 27, 1831, the HMS Beagle departed from Plymouth, England, initiating a momentous five-year scientific survey voyage around the world. Aboard was the young naturalist Charles Darwin, whose keen observations during this journey would lay the groundwork for his revolutionary theories on evolution. The expedition took Darwin to diverse regions, including the coast of South America and the Galápagos Islands, where he meticulously collected geological and biological specimens. His extensive research and findings from this voyage profoundly influenced his later development of the theory of natural selection. This journey is widely regarded as one of the most significant scientific expeditions in history.
