## 1789-07-14

On July 14, 1789, a Parisian mob stormed the Bastille, a royal fortress and prison in Paris, France. This event, a pivotal moment in the French Revolution, symbolized the people's defiance against the monarchy and the oppressive Ancien RÃ©gime.  The storming was spurred by rumors of royal troops amassing and a general sense of popular unrest.  The fall of the Bastille became a powerful rallying cry for the revolutionaries, marking the beginning of a new era in French history.
