On August 4, 1789, the French National Constituent Assembly voted to abolish feudalism in France.  This pivotal act marked a significant turning point in the French Revolution.  The decree effectively ended the system of hereditary privileges and obligations that had characterized the Ancien RÃ©gime.  It dismantled the complex web of feudal dues, services, and jurisdictions that bound peasants to the land and nobility. The abolition, however, was not immediately implemented uniformly throughout the country, and resistance and clarification were required in subsequent months.
