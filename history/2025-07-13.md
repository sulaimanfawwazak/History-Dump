## 1914-06-28

On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were assassinated in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Young Bosnian organization.  The assassination, which triggered a chain of events leading to World War I, occurred during the archduke's visit to the city. Princip's act was intended to destabilize Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The assassination sparked a diplomatic crisis, culminating in Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia on July 28, 1914.
