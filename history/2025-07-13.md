On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were assassinated in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Young Bosnia organization.  The assassination, which took place during the archduke's visit to Sarajevo, triggered a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I.  Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to Serbia, and when Serbia's response was deemed unsatisfactory, Austria-Hungary declared war. This event is widely considered a pivotal moment in the start of the First World War. The assassination dramatically escalated tensions in Europe, plunging the continent into a devastating global conflict.
