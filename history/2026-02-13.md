## 1960-02-13

On February 13, 1960, France successfully detonated its first atomic bomb, codenamed "Gerboise Bleue" (Blue Jerboa), in the Reggane desert region of French Algeria. This momentous test made France the fourth country, after the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, to acquire nuclear weapons capabilities. The explosion had an estimated yield of 70 kilotons, making it significantly more powerful than the atomic bombs used during World War II. This event marked France's entry into the exclusive club of nuclear powers and was a crucial step in establishing its independent nuclear deterrent, often referred to as the "force de frappe."
