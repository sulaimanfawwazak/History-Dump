On January 2, 1492, the Emirate of Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in Spain, surrendered to the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. This event marked the culmination of the Reconquista, a centuries-long period during which Christian kingdoms gradually reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from Muslim rule. The capitulation brought an end to over 700 years of Moorish presence in Spain, ushering in an era of unified Spanish rule and significant religious and cultural shifts. The city's surrender was formalized with the Treaty of Granada, initially promising religious tolerance for Muslims, though this promise was later revoked.
