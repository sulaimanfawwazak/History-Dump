## 1792-08-10

On August 10, 1792, during the radical phase of the French Revolution, revolutionaries stormed the Tuileries Palace in Paris. This violent uprising, led by the National Guard of the Paris Commune and fédérés from Marseille and Brittany, resulted in the overthrow of the French monarchy. King Louis XVI and his family sought refuge with the Legislative Assembly but were subsequently arrested and imprisoned. The insurrection marked a pivotal moment, effectively ending the constitutional monarchy and paving the way for the establishment of the First French Republic. Its immediate impact was the suspension of the king's powers and the convocation of a National Convention to draft a new constitution.
