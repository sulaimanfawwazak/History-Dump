## 1938-09-29

On September 29, 1938, the Munich Agreement was signed by representatives from Germany, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom. This diplomatic pact permitted Nazi Germany's annexation of portions of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland, a region bordering Germany and inhabited primarily by ethnic Germans. The agreement was a desperate attempt by European powers, particularly British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, to appease Adolf Hitler and avoid a larger war, with Chamberlain famously declaring he had secured "peace for our time." However, Czechoslovakia was not invited to the conference and was compelled to accept the terms, rendering the agreement a symbol of failed appeasement and a precursor to World War II.
