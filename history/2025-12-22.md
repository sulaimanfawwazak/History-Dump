## 1808-12-22

On December 22, 1808, Ludwig van Beethoven conducted a marathon four-hour concert at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, Austria. This historic performance marked the public debut of several of his major works, including the iconic Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Symphony No. 6 in F major (Pastoral), and the Choral Fantasy. Despite the cold venue and a less-than-rehearsed orchestra, the event showcased Beethoven's extraordinary genius. This evening cemented his legacy, introducing some of the most enduring pieces in classical music history to the world.
