## 1920-08-26

On August 26, 1920, the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution was officially certified by Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby. This landmark amendment guarantees all American women the right to vote, declaring that 'The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.' Its certification came after decades of relentless activism by the women's suffrage movement, which tirelessly campaigned for gender equality in the electoral process. The ratification by Tennessee a week prior secured the necessary two-thirds majority of states for its passage. This pivotal moment fundamentally transformed the American electorate and marked a monumental victory for civil rights.
