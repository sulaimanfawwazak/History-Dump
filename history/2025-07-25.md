On July 25, 1978, Louise Brown, the world's first human born via in vitro fertilization (IVF), was born at Oldham General Hospital in Oldham, England. Her birth marked a monumental breakthrough in reproductive medicine, offering hope to millions of infertile couples worldwide. The pioneering work was carried out by British physiologist Robert Edwards and gynecologist Patrick Steptoe, who had spent years developing the IVF technique. This event initiated a new era in reproductive technology and sparked significant ethical, social, and medical discussions globally.
