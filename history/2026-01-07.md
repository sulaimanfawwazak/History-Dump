## 1610-01-07

On January 7, 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei made his initial observation of what he first believed to be three new fixed stars near Jupiter through his improved telescope. Over the following nights, he continued his meticulous observations, and by January 13, he conclusively realized that these 'stars' were in fact orbiting Jupiter, identifying them as moons. This groundbreaking discovery, specifically of Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto (now known as the Galilean moons), provided compelling evidence for the Copernican heliocentric model of the universe. It profoundly challenged the prevailing geocentric view of the time and dramatically impacted the development of modern astronomy.
