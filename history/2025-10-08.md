On October 8, 1871, the Great Chicago Fire erupted in the city of Chicago, Illinois. Originating in a barn on DeKoven Street, the blaze spread rapidly due to strong winds, wooden buildings, and dry conditions following a severe drought. Over two days, the fire destroyed more than 3 square miles of the city, including over 17,000 buildings and much of the business district. The catastrophe resulted in an estimated 300 fatalities and left over 100,000 people homeless, prompting a massive rebuilding effort that significantly reshaped Chicago's urban landscape.
