## 1945-01-27

On January 27, 1945, the Soviet Red Army liberated the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp complex in occupied Poland during the final stages of World War II. Soviet soldiers discovered thousands of emaciated prisoners, along with horrifying evidence of the Nazi regime's systematic genocide, including gas chambers, crematoria, and immense piles of human remains and personal belongings. This event exposed the full scale and brutality of the Holocaust to the world, revealing the unspeakable atrocities committed against millions of Jews, Roma, Poles, and other minority groups. The liberation of Auschwitz became a powerful symbol of human suffering and resilience, prompting global efforts to commemorate victims and prevent future genocides, with January 27 now observed as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
