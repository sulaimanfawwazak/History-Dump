## 1605-11-05

On November 5, 1605, the infamous Gunpowder Plot was foiled in London, England. This was a failed assassination attempt against King James I and the English Parliament by a group of provincial English Catholics. Guy Fawkes was discovered guarding 36 barrels of gunpowder beneath the House of Lords, just hours before the scheduled State Opening of Parliament. His capture led to the immediate unravelling of the conspiracy and the arrest of other plotters, including Robert Catesby. The day is still commemorated annually in Britain as Guy Fawkes Night, with bonfires and fireworks.
