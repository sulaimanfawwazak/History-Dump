On September 16, 1987, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was signed in Montreal, Canada. This landmark international treaty aimed to protect the Earth's ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances responsible for ozone depletion, primarily chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The agreement represented unprecedented global cooperation in addressing an environmental crisis, uniting nearly every country in a common cause. Its successful implementation has led to a significant recovery of the ozone layer, preventing millions of cases of skin cancer and cataracts worldwide. The Montreal Protocol is widely regarded as one of the most successful international environmental agreements.
