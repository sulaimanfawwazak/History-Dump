## 1950-01-26

On January 26, 1950, India formally adopted its constitution and transformed into a sovereign socialist secular democratic republic. This momentous occasion, celebrated annually as Republic Day, marked the complete transition from British dominion to an independent nation. The constitution, enacted three years after gaining independence from British rule, established a parliamentary system of government. Jawaharlal Nehru served as the country's first Prime Minister, and Dr. Rajendra Prasad was sworn in as its first President. This day laid the foundational legal framework for modern India, ensuring fundamental rights and duties for its citizens.
