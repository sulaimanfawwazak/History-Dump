## 1973-09-11

On September 11, 1973, a military coup d'état, led by General Augusto Pinochet and supported by the United States, overthrew the democratically elected government of President Salvador Allende in Chile. The coup began with the military surrounding Santiago and bombing the presidential palace, La Moneda, where Allende made his last stand. Allende officially died by suicide during the assault, although circumstances surrounding his death have been debated for decades. This event marked the end of Chile's long tradition of democratic governance and ushered in a brutal 17-year military dictatorship under Pinochet. The regime was responsible for widespread human rights abuses, including torture, disappearances, and executions of thousands of political opponents.
