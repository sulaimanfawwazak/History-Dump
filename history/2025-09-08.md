## 1943-09-08

On September 8, 1943, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander, publicly announced that Italy had signed an armistice with the Allies. The secret agreement had been signed five days earlier in Cassibile, Sicily, by representatives of the Allied powers and the Kingdom of Italy. This declaration effectively ended Italy's participation in World War II on the side of the Axis powers, though fighting continued as Germany immediately launched Operation Achse to disarm Italian forces and occupy the country. The news led to confusion and chaos among Italian troops and civilians, with many seeking to evade German capture or join partisan resistance.
