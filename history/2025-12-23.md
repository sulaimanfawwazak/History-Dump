On December 23, 1913, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law. This act established the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States, in response to a series of financial panics, particularly the Panic of 1907. The system was designed to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. It comprises a Board of Governors, twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee, aiming to supervise banks, conduct monetary policy, and maintain financial stability.
