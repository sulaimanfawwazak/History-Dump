## 1939-11-30

On November 30, 1939, the Soviet Union launched a massive invasion of Finland, initiating what became known as the Winter War. This unprovoked attack followed the Soviet Union's demands for Finnish territory, including areas near Leningrad, which Finland steadfastly refused to cede. Despite being vastly outnumbered and outgunned, the Finnish forces mounted a fierce and highly effective defense against the Soviet Red Army. The conflict showcased the remarkable resilience of the Finnish people and their innovative military tactics, surprising the world with their ability to withstand the Soviet giant for over three months.
