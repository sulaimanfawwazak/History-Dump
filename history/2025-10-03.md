## 1990-10-03

On October 3, 1990, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) officially ceased to exist, completing its integration into the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). This pivotal event marked the end of Germany's 45-year post-World War II division, which had seen the country split into two distinct states amidst the Cold War. The reunification followed months of political negotiations and popular movements for change, notably the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. This historic moment, largely orchestrated by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, profoundly reshaped the European geopolitical landscape and symbolized the triumph of democratic ideals over communist rule.
