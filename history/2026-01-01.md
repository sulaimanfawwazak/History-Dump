## 1863-01-01

On January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation during the American Civil War. This executive order declared that all enslaved people in Confederate states in rebellion against the Union "shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free." While it did not immediately free all enslaved people, as it applied only to areas not under Union control, it significantly changed the purpose of the war, making the abolition of slavery a primary Union goal. The proclamation also allowed for the recruitment of African American soldiers into the Union Army, fundamentally altering the course and moral landscape of the conflict.
