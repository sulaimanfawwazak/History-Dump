## 1920-01-16

On January 16, 1920, the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ushering in the era of Prohibition, officially went into effect. This amendment prohibited the manufacture, sale, or transportation of alcoholic beverages nationwide. Ratified a year prior, its enforcement was facilitated by the Volstead Act. While intended to reduce crime and corruption, and improve health and morals, Prohibition paradoxically led to a rise in organized crime, illegal speakeasies, and bootlegging. It remained federal law for 13 years until its repeal by the 21st Amendment in 1933.
