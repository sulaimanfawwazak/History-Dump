On January 10, 1901, the Lucas Gusher at Spindletop Hill, near Beaumont, Texas, erupted, marking the beginning of the Texas oil boom and fundamentally transforming the global energy landscape. Drilled by Captain Anthony F. Lucas and funded by James M. Guffey and John H. Galey, the well struck oil at 1,139 feet, sending a column of crude oil over 150 feet into the air. This massive strike initially gushed at an astonishing rate of an estimated 100,000 barrels per day, far exceeding anything previously seen in the world. The discovery led to a rapid surge in oil production, drastically reducing oil prices and fueling the rise of major oil companies and the modern petroleum industry. Spindletop's success revolutionized transportation, manufacturing, and the economic development of the Southwestern United States, ushering in the age of oil.
