The American battleship USS Maine exploded and sank in Havana Harbor, Cuba, killing 260 of its crew members. While the exact cause remained contested, U.S. public opinion, heavily influenced by yellow journalism, immediately blamed Spain. This tragic incident became a powerful rallying cry, 'Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!', igniting widespread public support for military action. The sinking of the USS Maine was a pivotal event that directly contributed to the outbreak of the Spanish-American War just two months later.
