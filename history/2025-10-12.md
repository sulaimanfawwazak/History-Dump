## 1492-10-12

On October 12, 1492, Christopher Columbus, leading a Spanish expedition, made landfall in the Americas, specifically an island in the Bahamas which he named San Salvador, believed by some to be Guanahani. This marked the first recorded contact between Europeans and the indigenous peoples of the New World, specifically the Lucayan, Ta√≠no, Arawak. His arrival initiated the European colonization of the Americas, profoundly altering the course of global history and leading to immense cultural exchange and, tragically, the displacement and devastation of many native populations. The voyage was funded by the Spanish monarchs, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, seeking a westward sea route to Asia.
