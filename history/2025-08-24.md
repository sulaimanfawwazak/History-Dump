## 1572-08-24

On August 24, 1572, the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre began in Paris, France, and spread to other parts of the country in the following weeks. This brutal episode of targeted violence by Catholic mobs against Huguenots (French Calvinist Protestants) occurred during the French Wars of Religion. The massacre was initiated just days after the marriage of the Catholic King's sister, Margaret of Valois, to the Protestant Henry III of Navarre, an event intended to reconcile the two factions. Estimates of the dead vary widely, but tens of thousands of Protestants were killed, severely weakening the Huguenot political movement. The event remains a dark stain on French history and a symbol of religious intolerance.
