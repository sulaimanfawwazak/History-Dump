Italian Dominican friar, philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake in Rome's Campo de' Fiori by the Roman Inquisition. He was condemned for heresy after rejecting several core Catholic doctrines, including the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, and the virginity of Mary. Bruno was also a prominent proponent of an infinite universe and a multitude of worlds, ideas that challenged the established geocentric view. His execution has since become a powerful symbol of free thought and scientific inquiry facing religious dogma.
