## 1973-10-20

The 'Saturday Night Massacre' occurred on October 20, 1973, during the escalating Watergate scandal in the United States. President Richard Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating the scandal and had subpoenaed Nixon's Oval Office tapes. Richardson refused to comply and resigned in protest, as did Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus when he received the same order. Solicitor General Robert Bork ultimately carried out the firing of Cox, plunging the Nixon administration into a constitutional crisis. This dramatic event further intensified public and congressional calls for Nixon's impeachment, significantly weakening his presidency and ultimately leading to his resignation less than a year later.
