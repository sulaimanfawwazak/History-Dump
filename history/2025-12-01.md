## 1955-12-01

On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, an African American seamstress and NAACP activist, famously refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Her subsequent arrest for civil disobedience ignited the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a pivotal event in the Civil Rights Movement. Led by Martin Luther King Jr., the boycott lasted 381 days and severely impacted the city's public transportation system. It ultimately led to a Supreme Court ruling that declared segregation on public buses unconstitutional. This courageous act and the ensuing boycott marked a major victory against racial segregation in the United States.
