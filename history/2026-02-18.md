## 1930-02-18

On February 18, 1930, American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Tombaugh's systematic search for a 'Planet X,' predicted by Percival Lowell, involved comparing photographic plates taken weeks apart. The newly found celestial body was initially classified as the ninth planet in our solar system, a status it held for 76 years. This discovery significantly expanded our understanding of the outer reaches of the solar system and captured public imagination, although Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.
