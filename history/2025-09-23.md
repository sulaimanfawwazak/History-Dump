## 1846-09-23

On September 23, 1846, the planet Neptune was officially discovered by astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle at the Berlin Observatory. This significant find was based on calculations by French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier, who predicted the planet's existence and position due to observed perturbations in Uranus's orbit. Assisting Galle was student Heinrich Louis d'Arrest, who identified Neptune less than an hour after starting their search. The discovery marked a triumph for celestial mechanics and cemented the predictive power of Newtonian gravitational theory. It expanded the known boundaries of our solar system and profoundly impacted astronomical understanding.
