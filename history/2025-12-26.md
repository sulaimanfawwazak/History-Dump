On December 26, 2004, a massive earthquake, measuring between 9.1 and 9.3 on the moment magnitude scale, struck off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. This underwater megathrust earthquake was one of the largest ever recorded and caused a series of devastating tsunamis across the Indian Ocean. The giant waves impacted coastal communities in fourteen countries, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand, traveling thousands of kilometers. It resulted in an estimated 230,000 to 280,000 fatalities, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history and prompting a massive international humanitarian response. The event significantly raised global awareness about tsunami detection and warning systems.
