## 1929-02-14

On February 14, 1929, seven members and associates of Chicago's North Side Gang, led by Bugs Moran, were gunned down at a garage in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. The massacre was orchestrated by Al Capone's South Side Italian gang, although Capone himself was in Florida at the time. The victims were lined up against a wall and shot by men disguised as police officers, in what became a notorious event of gangland violence during the Prohibition era. This brutal act significantly escalated public concern about organized crime and heightened the rivalry between Moran and Capone, becoming one of the most infamous crimes in American history. The event led to widespread outrage and a renewed focus on combating the rampant criminality of the time.
