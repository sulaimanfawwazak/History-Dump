## 1995-11-21

On November 21, 1995, the Dayton Agreement was formally signed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, bringing an end to the brutal 3.5-year-long Bosnian War. The peace accord was negotiated between the presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia—Alija Izetbegović, Franjo Tuđman, and Slobodan Milošević, respectively—under the mediation of U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. This historic agreement established Bosnia and Herzegovina as a single sovereign state, divided into two distinct entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. While ending the immediate conflict, the complex political structure it created continues to influence the region's governance and ethnic relations today.
