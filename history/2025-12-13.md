On December 13, 2003, former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in a small, underground hideout near Ad-Dawr, a village south of his hometown of Tikrit. Codenamed "Operation Red Dawn," the capture concluded a nine-month intensive manhunt for the ousted dictator following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Hussein was found disheveled but unharmed, hiding in a "spider hole" designed to evade detection. His capture was a significant victory for the coalition forces, leading to his trial for crimes against humanity and ultimately his execution in 2006.
