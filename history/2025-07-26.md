## 1956-07-26

On July 26, 1956, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, which had been under British and French control since its construction. This decisive action was taken to fund the construction of the Aswan High Dam after Western nations, particularly the United States and Britain, withdrew their financial support offers. Nasser's move asserted Egypt's sovereignty over a crucial waterway vital for international shipping and oil transport. The nationalization immediately triggered the Suez Crisis, a major international geopolitical confrontation involving Egypt, Britain, France, and Israel.
