On December 21, 1968, NASA launched Apollo 8, the first crewed spacecraft to leave Earth orbit and travel to the Moon. The mission carried astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and William Anders, who became the first humans to orbit the Moon, completing ten orbits over 20 hours. This groundbreaking flight provided humanity with its first close-up views of the lunar surface and famously captured the iconic 'Earthrise' photograph. Apollo 8's success was a critical milestone in the Space Race, proving the technology and procedures necessary for lunar travel. Its safe return on December 27 boosted morale and paved the way for the Apollo 11 lunar landing just seven months later.
