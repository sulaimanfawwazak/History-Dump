## 1822-09-07

On September 7, 1822, Prince Dom Pedro of Brazil declared the country's independence from the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves. This pivotal moment, often referred to as the "Cry of Ipiranga" (Grito do Ipiranga), took place on the banks of the Ipiranga river near SÃ£o Paulo. Dom Pedro, who had been left as regent by his father King John VI, defied orders from Portugal to return to Lisbon, opting instead to establish Brazil as an independent empire with himself as its first emperor. This act marked the formal end of over three centuries of Portuguese colonial rule and the beginning of the Empire of Brazil. The declaration was a culmination of growing dissatisfaction with Portuguese attempts to reassert control over Brazil following the departure of the Portuguese Royal Family.
