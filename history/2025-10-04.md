On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial Earth satellite, from Baikonur Cosmodrome. This groundbreaking achievement marked the beginning of the Space Age and ignited the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Sputnik 1 orbited Earth for three weeks, emitting radio signals that could be picked up by amateur radio operators worldwide. Its launch had profound implications for science, education, and national security, demonstrating Soviet technological capabilities and prompting an acceleration of American space efforts. The satellite burned up upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere on January 4, 1958.
