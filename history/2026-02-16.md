## 1968-02-16

On February 16, 1968, the United States launched its first 911 emergency telephone system in Haleyville, Alabama. This landmark event provided citizens with a single, easy-to-remember number for immediate access to police, fire, and medical services. Alabama Speaker of the House Rankin Fite made the very first 911 call from the city's mayor's office to U.S. Representative Tom Bevill. This pioneering system quickly became the standard nationwide, dramatically improving public safety and response times to crises. Its implementation fundamentally transformed how emergency services were accessed across the country.
