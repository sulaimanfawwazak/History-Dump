## 1958-07-29

On July 29, 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act into law, officially establishing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This act was a direct response to the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957, which ignited the "Space Race" and raised concerns about American technological superiority. NASA absorbed the existing National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and several other research institutions, consolidating the nation's civilian space efforts. Its creation marked a pivotal moment, leading to groundbreaking achievements in space exploration, including the Apollo moon landings and numerous scientific missions.
