On September 26, 1960, the first-ever televised U.S. presidential debate took place in Chicago, Illinois. Democratic nominee John F. Kennedy and Republican nominee Richard Nixon engaged in a historic ninety-minute discussion, moderated by Howard K. Smith. While those listening on radio often felt Nixon performed better, television viewers were struck by Kennedy's youthful vigor and confident demeanor compared to Nixon's somewhat pale and ill-looking appearance. This event marked a pivotal moment in American politics, instantly demonstrating the profound impact of television on public perception and campaign strategy. It fundamentally reshaped how presidential candidates would connect with the electorate.
