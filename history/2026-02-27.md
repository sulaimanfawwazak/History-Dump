## 1933-02-27

On February 27, 1933, the German Reichstag (parliament building) in Berlin was engulfed in flames. Marinus van der Lubbe, a Dutch communist, was discovered at the scene and confessed to the arson. The Nazi Party, under Adolf Hitler, immediately accused communists of orchestrating the fire, exploiting the incident to suspend civil liberties and solidify their power through the Reichstag Fire Decree. This pivotal event served as a major stepping stone in Hitler's ascent to absolute dictatorial control in Germany, effectively dismantling the democratic system. It allowed for the mass arrest of political opponents and the suppression of dissent.
