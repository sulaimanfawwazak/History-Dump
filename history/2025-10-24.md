## 1945-10-24

On October 24, 1945, the Charter of the United Nations officially came into force, marking the formal establishment of the international organization. This momentous occasion occurred after the required number of nations had ratified the treaty, which was signed by 50 countries in San Francisco earlier that year. The UN was founded with the primary goals of maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations, and promoting social progress, better living standards, and human rights. Its formation was a direct response to the devastating failures of the League of Nations and the horrors of World War II, signifying a global commitment to prevent future conflicts and foster cooperation. The date is now celebrated annually as United Nations Day.
