## 1066-10-14

The Battle of Hastings was fought on October 14, 1066, between the Norman-French army of William, Duke of Normandy, and an English army under the Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson. The battle took place at Senlac Hill, approximately 7 miles northwest of Hastings, England. Harold was killed during the battle, traditionally said to be struck by an arrow, leading to a decisive Norman victory. This pivotal event marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule in England and the beginning of the Norman Conquest, profoundly influencing English language, culture, and government. William was subsequently crowned King of England on Christmas Day of the same year.
