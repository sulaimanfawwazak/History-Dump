On December 12, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark per curiam decision in the case of Bush v. Gore. This ruling effectively ended the controversial manual recount of presidential election ballots in Florida, which had been initiated following the extremely close election results between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. The Court's 5-4 decision cited an Equal Protection Clause violation, arguing that varying standards used in different counties for counting undervotes were unconstitutional. Ultimately, the judgment solidified George W. Bush's victory in the 2000 presidential election, making him the 43rd President of the United States. This decision remains one of the most significant and debated judicial rulings in American history.
