## 1787-09-17

On September 17, 1787, the U.S. Constitution was signed by 39 of the 55 delegates attending the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This pivotal document established the federal government of the United States and defined its relationship with the states and citizens. George Washington presided over the convention, which had convened in May to revise the Articles of Confederation but ultimately drafted an entirely new framework. The signing marked a crucial step in the formation of the American republic, though ratification by individual states was still required. It laid the foundation for the enduring system of government, including its checks and balances, that largely continues to function today.
