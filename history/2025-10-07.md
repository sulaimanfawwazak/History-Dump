On October 7, 1571, the Battle of Lepanto took place in the Gulf of Patras, off the western coast of Greece. This monumental naval engagement saw the Holy League, a coalition of southern European Catholic maritime states, confront the formidable fleet of the Ottoman Empire. Led by Don John of Austria, the Holy League achieved a decisive victory, crippling the Ottoman navy. This crucial triumph significantly curtailed Ottoman expansionist ambitions in the Western Mediterranean. The battle is widely considered a turning point in the Ottoman-Habsburg struggle for naval supremacy.
