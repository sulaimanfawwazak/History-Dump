## 1914-07-28

On July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, marking the official beginning of World War I. This declaration followed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife, Sophie, in Sarajevo a month earlier by a Serbian nationalist. Despite Serbia's attempts to appease Vienna, Austria-Hungary, backed by Germany, issued an ultimatum that was largely rejected. The declaration triggered a cascade of military mobilizations and declarations of war among the Great Powers of Europe, rapidly escalating a regional conflict into a global catastrophe. This event set in motion four years of devastating warfare that profoundly reshaped the political map of the world.
