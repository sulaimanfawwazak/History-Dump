## 1911-12-14

Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen and his four companions became the first humans to reach the geographic South Pole on December 14, 1911. Their successful expedition, utilizing skis and dog sleds, marked a pivotal moment in polar exploration. Amundsen's team arrived just 35 days ahead of a rival British expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott, who tragically perished on the return journey. This achievement cemented Amundsen's legacy as a masterful planner and navigator in extreme environments, vastly contributing to the world's geographical knowledge.
