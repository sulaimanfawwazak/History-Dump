The Munich Agreement was signed on September 30, 1938, by Nazi Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy in Munich. This pact permitted Germany's annexation of the Sudetenland, a region of western Czechoslovakia inhabited by a German-speaking minority. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain returned claiming "peace for our time," but the agreement is widely seen as a failed act of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler's expansionist policies. Czechoslovakia was not invited to the conference and lost significant border fortifications and territory, effectively paving the way for Germany's complete occupation of the country within six months.
