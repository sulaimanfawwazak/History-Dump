## 1777-11-15

On November 15, 1777, the Continental Congress, meeting in York, Pennsylvania, formally adopted the Articles of Confederation. This document served as the first constitution of the United States, establishing a loose confederation of sovereign states and a weak central government. It reflected the American colonies' fear of a strong central authority, a sentiment largely stemming from their experience under British rule. While the Articles provided a framework for governing during the Revolutionary War and helped guide the nation's early foreign policy, its significant limitations, particularly regarding taxation and enforcing laws, became apparent. These shortcomings eventually led to its replacement by the United States Constitution in 1789.
