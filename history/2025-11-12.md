On November 12, 1980, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft made its closest approach to the planet Saturn, passing within 77,000 miles (124,000 km) of the planet's cloud tops. This flyby provided humanity with unprecedented detailed images and data of Saturn, its rings, and several of its moons, including Titan, which the probe was designed to investigate closely. Voyager 1 discovered new moons and revealed the complex structure of Saturn's rings. This mission significantly advanced our understanding of the outer solar system and paved the way for future planetary exploration.
