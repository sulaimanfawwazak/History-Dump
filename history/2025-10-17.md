## 1931-10-17

On October 17, 1931, notorious American gangster Al Capone was convicted on five counts of income tax evasion by a federal jury in Chicago. After years of evading prosecution for violent crimes and bootlegging during the Prohibition era, federal agents, led by Eliot Ness and his "Untouchables," finally built a case focusing on his failure to pay taxes on his illicit earnings. Capone, once a powerful crime boss, was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison, a significant blow to organized crime. This conviction marked a pivotal moment in American law enforcement, demonstrating that even the most formidable criminals could be brought to justice through financial investigation.
