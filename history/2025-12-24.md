## 1968-12-24

On December 24, 1968, the Apollo 8 mission, crewed by Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders, successfully entered lunar orbit. This historic achievement marked the first time humans had ever orbited another celestial body. The astronauts performed a series of ten orbits, broadcasting live television images of the lunar surface and famously reading from the Book of Genesis on Christmas Eve. The mission provided critical data for future lunar landings and offered humanity its first direct view of "Earthrise," a profound image of Earth seen from lunar orbit, significantly boosting morale and public interest in the space program.
