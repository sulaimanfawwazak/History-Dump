Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev delivered his 'Secret Speech' to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Titled 'On the Cult of Personality and its Consequences,' the speech denounced the crimes of Joseph Stalin, particularly his purges and leadership style. Khrushchev criticized Stalin's tyrannical rule and the extensive purges that led to the deaths of millions, marking a significant break from the past. Although initially delivered in a closed session, the speech was soon leaked internationally, sending shockwaves through the global communist movement. It initiated a period of 'de-Stalinization' within the Soviet Union and its satellite states, profoundly impacting Cold War politics.
