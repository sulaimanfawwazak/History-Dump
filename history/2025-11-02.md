## 1917-11-02

On November 2, 1917, Arthur Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary, issued the Balfour Declaration. This public statement, addressed to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, expressed the British government's support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine. Crucially, it included a provision that "nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine." The declaration significantly influenced British policy regarding Mandatory Palestine. It laid foundational groundwork for the creation of the State of Israel decades later, becoming a pivotal document in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
