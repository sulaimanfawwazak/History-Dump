## 1881-10-26

On October 26, 1881, the legendary Gunfight at the O.K. Corral erupted in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. This iconic shootout pitted lawmen Virgil, Wyatt, and Morgan Earp, along with Doc Holliday, against a group of outlaws known as the Cowboys, led by Billy Claiborne, Ike and Billy Clanton, and Frank and Tom McLaury. The brief but violent exchange of gunfire, lasting only about 30 seconds, resulted in the deaths of Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers. Though controversial at the time, the event became a quintessential tale of the American Old West, immortalized in countless books, films, and television shows. It remains a significant moment in the history of frontier justice and the struggle between order and lawlessness.
