## 1914-07-23

On July 23, 1914, Austria-Hungary delivered an ultimatum to Serbia following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. The demanding ten-point note held Serbia responsible for the assassination and insisted on a severe crackdown on anti-Austrian activities within its borders. Serbia accepted most, but not all, of the demands, which Austria-Hungary deemed insufficient within the strict 48-hour deadline. This rejection directly led to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Serbia a few days later, thereby triggering the start of World War I.
